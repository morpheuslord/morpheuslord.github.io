# Welcome to your Lovable project

## Project info

**URL**: https://lovable.dev/projects/REPLACE_WITH_PROJECT_ID

## How can I edit this code?

There are several ways of editing your application.

**Use Lovable**

Simply visit the [Lovable Project](https://lovable.dev/projects/REPLACE_WITH_PROJECT_ID) and start prompting.

Changes made via Lovable will be committed automatically to this repo.

**Use your preferred IDE**

If you want to work locally using your own IDE, you can clone this repo and push changes. Pushed changes will also be reflected in Lovable.

The only requirement is having Node.js & npm installed - [install with nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#installing-and-updating)

**Important**: This project requires **Node.js 18+** (Vite requires Node.js 14.18+ or 16+, but we recommend 18+ for best compatibility).

Follow these steps:

```sh
# Step 1: Clone the repository using the project's Git URL.
git clone <YOUR_GIT_URL>

# Step 2: Navigate to the project directory.
cd <YOUR_PROJECT_NAME>

# Step 3: If using nvm, install and use Node.js 18+
nvm install 18
nvm use 18
# Or if .nvmrc exists, just run:
nvm use

# Step 4: Verify Node.js version (should be 18+)
node --version

# Step 5: Install the necessary dependencies.
npm i

# Step 6: Start the development server with auto-reloading and an instant preview.
npm run dev
```

**Troubleshooting**: If you encounter `SyntaxError: Unexpected token {` when running `npm run dev`, it means your Node.js version is too old. Upgrade to Node.js 18+ using nvm or your system's package manager.

**Edit a file directly in GitHub**

- Navigate to the desired file(s).
- Click the "Edit" button (pencil icon) at the top right of the file view.
- Make your changes and commit the changes.

**Use GitHub Codespaces**

- Navigate to the main page of your repository.
- Click on the "Code" button (green button) near the top right.
- Select the "Codespaces" tab.
- Click on "New codespace" to launch a new Codespace environment.
- Edit files directly within the Codespace and commit and push your changes once you're done.
