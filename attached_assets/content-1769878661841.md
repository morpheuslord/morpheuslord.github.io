# D3 gallery

Looking for a good D3 example? Here’s a few (okay, 173…) to peruse.

### Animation

D3’s [data join](https://d3js.org/d3-selection/joining), [interpolators](https://d3js.org/d3-interpolate), and [easings](https://d3js.org/d3-ease) enable flexible [animated transitions](https://d3js.org/d3-transition) between views while preserving [object constancy](https://bost.ocks.org/mike/constancy/).

[Animated treemap](https://observablehq.com/@d3/animated-treemap "Animated treemap by D3") [Temporal force-directed graph](https://observablehq.com/@d3/temporal-force-directed-graph "Temporal force-directed graph by D3") [Connected scatterplot](https://observablehq.com/@d3/connected-scatterplot/2 "Connected scatterplot by D3") [The wealth & health of nations](https://observablehq.com/@mbostock/the-wealth-health-of-nations "The wealth & health of nations by Mike Bostock") [Scatterplot tour](https://observablehq.com/@d3/scatterplot-tour "Scatterplot tour by D3") [Bar chart race](https://observablehq.com/@d3/bar-chart-race "Bar chart race by D3") [Stacked-to-grouped bars](https://observablehq.com/@d3/stacked-to-grouped-bars "Stacked-to-grouped bars by D3") [Streamgraph transitions](https://observablehq.com/@d3/streamgraph-transitions "Streamgraph transitions by D3") [Smooth zooming](https://observablehq.com/@d3/smooth-zooming "Smooth zooming by D3") [Zoom to bounding box](https://observablehq.com/@d3/zoom-to-bounding-box "Zoom to bounding box by D3") [Orthographic to equirectangular](https://observablehq.com/@d3/orthographic-to-equirectangular "Orthographic to equirectangular by D3") [World tour](https://observablehq.com/@d3/world-tour "World tour by D3") [Walmart’s growth](https://observablehq.com/@d3/walmarts-growth "Walmart’s growth by D3") [Hierarchical bar chart](https://observablehq.com/@d3/hierarchical-bar-chart "Hierarchical bar chart by D3") [Zoomable treemap](https://observablehq.com/@d3/zoomable-treemap "Zoomable treemap by D3") [Zoomable circle packing](https://observablehq.com/@d3/zoomable-circle-packing "Zoomable circle packing by D3") [Collapsible tree](https://observablehq.com/@d3/collapsible-tree "Collapsible tree by D3") [Zoomable icicle](https://observablehq.com/@d3/zoomable-icicle "Zoomable icicle by D3") [Zoomable sunburst](https://observablehq.com/@d3/zoomable-sunburst "Zoomable sunburst by D3") [Sortable bar chart](https://observablehq.com/@d3/bar-chart-transitions/2 "Sortable bar chart by D3") [Icelandic population by age, 1841–2019](https://observablehq.com/@d3/icelandic-population-by-age-1841-2019 "Icelandic population by age, 1841–2019 by D3") [Pie chart update](https://observablehq.com/@d3/pie-chart-update "Pie chart update by D3") [Arc tween](https://observablehq.com/@d3/arc-tween "Arc tween by D3")

### Interaction

D3’s low-level approach allows for performant incremental updates during interaction. And D3 supports popular interaction methods including [dragging](https://d3js.org/d3-drag), [brushing](https://d3js.org/d3-brush), and [zooming](https://d3js.org/d3-zoom).

[Versor dragging](https://observablehq.com/@d3/versor-dragging "Versor dragging by D3") [Index chart](https://observablehq.com/@d3/index-chart/2 "Index chart by D3") [Sequences sunburst](https://observablehq.com/@kerryrodden/sequences-sunburst "Sequences sunburst by Kerry Rodden") [Brushable scatterplot](https://observablehq.com/@d3/brushable-scatterplot "Brushable scatterplot by D3") [Brushable scatterplot matrix](https://observablehq.com/@d3/brushable-scatterplot-matrix "Brushable scatterplot matrix by D3") [Pannable chart](https://observablehq.com/@d3/pannable-chart "Pannable chart by D3") [Zoomable area chart](https://observablehq.com/@d3/zoomable-area-chart "Zoomable area chart by D3") [Zoomable bar chart](https://observablehq.com/@d3/zoomable-bar-chart "Zoomable bar chart by D3") [Seamless zoomable map tiles](https://observablehq.com/@d3/seamless-zoomable-map-tiles "Seamless zoomable map tiles by D3")

### Analysis

D3 is for more than visualization; it includes tools for quantitative analysis, such as [data transformation](https://d3js.org/d3-array), [random number generation](https://d3js.org/d3-random), [hexagonal binning](https://observablehq.com/collection/@d3/d3-hexbin), and [contours via marching squares](https://d3js.org/d3-contour).

[Moving average](https://observablehq.com/@d3/moving-average "Moving average by D3") [Bollinger bands](https://observablehq.com/@d3/bollinger-bands/2 "Bollinger bands by D3") [Box plot](https://observablehq.com/@d3/box-plot/2 "Box plot by D3") [Histogram](https://observablehq.com/@d3/histogram/2 "Histogram by D3") [Kernel density estimation](https://observablehq.com/@d3/kernel-density-estimation "Kernel density estimation by D3") [Density contours](https://observablehq.com/@d3/density-contours "Density contours by D3") [Volcano contours](https://observablehq.com/@d3/volcano-contours/2 "Volcano contours by D3") [Contours](https://observablehq.com/@d3/contours "Contours by D3") [Hexbin](https://observablehq.com/@d3/hexbin "Hexbin by D3") [Hexbin (area)](https://observablehq.com/@d3/hexbin-area "Hexbin (area) by D3") [Hexbin map](https://observablehq.com/@d3/hexbin-map "Hexbin map by D3") [Q–Q plot](https://observablehq.com/@d3/q-q-plot "Q–Q plot by D3") [Normal quantile plot](https://observablehq.com/@d3/normal-quantile-plot "Normal quantile plot by D3") [Parallel sets](https://observablehq.com/@d3/parallel-sets "Parallel sets by D3")

### Hierarchies

D3 supports [hierarchical data](https://d3js.org/d3-hierarchy), too, with popular layouts such as [treemaps](https://d3js.org/d3-hierarchy/treemap), [tidy trees](https://d3js.org/d3-hierarchy/tree), and [packed circles](https://d3js.org/d3-hierarchy/pack). And you retain complete control over how the data is displayed.

[Treemap](https://observablehq.com/@d3/treemap/2 "Treemap by D3") [Cascaded treemap](https://observablehq.com/@d3/cascaded-treemap "Cascaded treemap by D3") [Nested treemap](https://observablehq.com/@d3/nested-treemap "Nested treemap by D3") [Circle packing](https://observablehq.com/@d3/pack/2 "Circle packing by D3") [Indented tree](https://observablehq.com/@d3/indented-tree "Indented tree by D3") [Tidy tree](https://observablehq.com/@d3/tree/2 "Tidy tree by D3") [Radial tidy tree](https://observablehq.com/@d3/radial-tree/2 "Radial tidy tree by D3") [Cluster dendrogram](https://observablehq.com/@d3/cluster/2 "Cluster dendrogram by D3") [Radial dendrogram](https://observablehq.com/@d3/radial-cluster/2 "Radial dendrogram by D3") [Sunburst](https://observablehq.com/@d3/sunburst/2 "Sunburst by D3") [Icicle](https://observablehq.com/@d3/icicle/2 "Icicle by D3") [Tangled tree visualization](https://observablehq.com/@nitaku/tangled-tree-visualization-ii "Tangled tree visualization by Matteo Abrate") [Phylogenetic tree](https://observablehq.com/@d3/tree-of-life "Phylogenetic tree by D3") [Force-directed tree](https://observablehq.com/@d3/force-directed-tree "Force-directed tree by D3")

### Networks

D3 works with networked data (graphs), including [simulated forces](https://d3js.org/d3-force) for resolving competing constraints and an iterative [Sankey layout](https://observablehq.com/collection/@d3/d3-sankey).

[Force-directed graph](https://observablehq.com/@d3/force-directed-graph/2 "Force-directed graph by D3") [Disjoint force-directed graph](https://observablehq.com/@d3/disjoint-force-directed-graph/2 "Disjoint force-directed graph by D3") [Mobile patent suits](https://observablehq.com/@d3/mobile-patent-suits "Mobile patent suits by D3") [Arc diagram](https://observablehq.com/@d3/arc-diagram "Arc diagram by D3") [Sankey diagram](https://observablehq.com/@d3/sankey/2 "Sankey diagram by D3") [Hierarchical edge bundling](https://observablehq.com/@d3/hierarchical-edge-bundling "Hierarchical edge bundling by D3") [Hierarchical edge bundling](https://observablehq.com/@d3/hierarchical-edge-bundling/2 "Hierarchical edge bundling by D3") [Chord diagram](https://observablehq.com/@d3/chord-diagram "Chord diagram by D3") [Chord diagram](https://observablehq.com/@d3/chord-diagram/2 "Chord diagram by D3") [Directed chord diagram](https://observablehq.com/@d3/directed-chord-diagram/2 "Directed chord diagram by D3") [Chord dependency diagram](https://observablehq.com/@d3/chord-dependency-diagram/2 "Chord dependency diagram by D3")

### Bars

D3 [scales](https://d3js.org/d3-scale) and [axes](https://d3js.org/d3-axis) support basic charts. Or invent a new form that better serves your needs.

[Bar chart](https://observablehq.com/@d3/bar-chart/2 "Bar chart by D3") [Horizontal bar chart](https://observablehq.com/@d3/horizontal-bar-chart/2 "Horizontal bar chart by D3") [Diverging bar chart](https://observablehq.com/@d3/diverging-bar-chart/2 "Diverging bar chart by D3") [Stacked bar chart](https://observablehq.com/@d3/stacked-bar-chart/2 "Stacked bar chart by D3") [Stacked horizontal bar chart](https://observablehq.com/@d3/stacked-horizontal-bar-chart/2 "Stacked horizontal bar chart by D3") [Stacked normalized horizontal bar chart](https://observablehq.com/@d3/stacked-normalized-horizontal-bar/2 "Stacked normalized horizontal bar chart by D3") [Grouped bar chart](https://observablehq.com/@d3/grouped-bar-chart/2 "Grouped bar chart by D3") [Diverging stacked bar chart](https://observablehq.com/@d3/diverging-stacked-bar-chart/2 "Diverging stacked bar chart by D3") [Marimekko chart](https://observablehq.com/@d3/marimekko-chart "Marimekko chart by D3") [World history timeline](https://observablehq.com/@tezzutezzu/world-history-timeline "World history timeline by Danilo Di Cuia") [Calendar](https://observablehq.com/@d3/calendar/2 "Calendar by D3") [The impact of vaccines](https://observablehq.com/@d3/the-impact-of-vaccines "The impact of vaccines by D3") [Electricity usage, 2019](https://observablehq.com/@mbostock/electric-usage-2019 "Electricity usage, 2019 by Mike Bostock") [Revenue by music format, 1973–2018](https://observablehq.com/@d3/revenue-by-music-format-1973-2018 "Revenue by music format, 1973–2018 by D3")

### Lines

With direct control over [graphics](https://d3js.org/d3-shape), and support for both SVG and Canvas, the possibilities are endless.

[Line chart](https://observablehq.com/@d3/line-chart/2 "Line chart by D3") [Line with missing data](https://observablehq.com/@d3/line-chart-missing-data/2 "Line with missing data by D3") [Multi-line chart](https://observablehq.com/@d3/multi-line-chart/2 "Multi-line chart by D3") [Change line chart](https://observablehq.com/@d3/change-line-chart/2 "Change line chart by D3") [Slope chart](https://observablehq.com/@d3/slope-chart/3 "Slope chart by D3") [Slope chart II](https://observablehq.com/@d3/cancer-survival-rates/2 "Slope chart II by D3") [Marey’s trains](https://observablehq.com/@d3/mareys-trains "Marey’s trains by D3") [Candlestick chart](https://observablehq.com/@d3/candlestick-chart/2 "Candlestick chart by D3") [Variable-color line](https://observablehq.com/@d3/variable-color-line "Variable-color line by D3") [Gradient encoding](https://observablehq.com/@d3/gradient-encoding "Gradient encoding by D3") [Threshold encoding](https://observablehq.com/@d3/threshold-encoding "Threshold encoding by D3") [Parallel coordinates](https://observablehq.com/@d3/parallel-coordinates "Parallel coordinates by D3") [Inequality in American cities](https://observablehq.com/@d3/inequality-in-american-cities "Inequality in American cities by D3") [New zealand tourists, 1921–2018](https://observablehq.com/@d3/new-zealand-tourists-1921-2018 "New zealand tourists, 1921–2018 by D3") [Sea ice extent, 1978–2017](https://observablehq.com/@d3/sea-ice-extent-1978-2017 "Sea ice extent, 1978–2017 by D3")

### Areas

Go beyond basic area charts with [difference charts](https://observablehq.com/@d3/difference-chart/2) or [streamgraphs](https://observablehq.com/@d3/streamgraph/2). [Ridgeline plots](https://observablehq.com/@d3/ridgeline-plot) and [horizon charts](https://observablehq.com/@d3/horizon-chart/2) are great for comparing many simultaneous time series.

[Area chart](https://observablehq.com/@d3/area-chart/2 "Area chart by D3") [Area with missing data](https://observablehq.com/@d3/area-chart-missing-data/2 "Area with missing data by D3") [Stacked area chart](https://observablehq.com/@d3/stacked-area-chart/2 "Stacked area chart by D3") [Normalized stacked area chart](https://observablehq.com/@d3/normalized-stacked-area-chart/2 "Normalized stacked area chart by D3") [U.S. population by state, 1790–1990](https://observablehq.com/@d3/u-s-population-by-state-1790-1990 "U.S. population by state, 1790–1990 by D3") [Streamgraph](https://observablehq.com/@d3/streamgraph/2 "Streamgraph by D3") [Difference chart](https://observablehq.com/@d3/difference-chart/2 "Difference chart by D3") [Band chart](https://observablehq.com/@d3/band-chart/2 "Band chart by D3") [Ridgeline (joy) plot](https://observablehq.com/@d3/ridgeline-plot "Ridgeline (joy) plot by D3") [Horizon chart](https://observablehq.com/@d3/horizon-chart/2 "Horizon chart by D3") [Realtime horizon chart](https://observablehq.com/@d3/realtime-horizon-chart "Realtime horizon chart by D3")

### Dots

Don’t forget the humble scatterplot. For a single dimension, consider the [beeswarm](https://observablehq.com/@d3/beeswarm/2); for finding pairwise dimensional correlations, try a [SPLOM](https://observablehq.com/@d3/splom/2).

[Scatterplot](https://observablehq.com/@d3/scatterplot/2 "Scatterplot by D3") [Scatterplot with shapes](https://observablehq.com/@d3/scatterplot-with-shapes "Scatterplot with shapes by D3") [Scatterplot matrix](https://observablehq.com/@d3/splom/2 "Scatterplot matrix by D3") [Dot plot](https://observablehq.com/@d3/dot-plot/2 "Dot plot by D3") [Global temperature trends](https://observablehq.com/@d3/global-temperature-trends "Global temperature trends by D3") [Bubble map](https://observablehq.com/@d3/bubble-map/2 "Bubble map by D3") [Spike map](https://observablehq.com/@d3/spike-map/2 "Spike map by D3") [Bubble chart](https://observablehq.com/@d3/bubble-chart/2 "Bubble chart by D3") [Beeswarm](https://observablehq.com/@d3/beeswarm/2 "Beeswarm by D3") [Mirrored beeswarm](https://observablehq.com/@d3/beeswarm-mirrored/2 "Mirrored beeswarm by D3") [Hertzsprung–Russell diagram](https://observablehq.com/@d3/hertzsprung-russell-diagram "Hertzsprung–Russell diagram by D3")

### Radial

Pies and donuts are good for comparing a part to the whole. And radial layouts can be appropriate for cyclical data.

[Pie chart](https://observablehq.com/@d3/pie-chart/2 "Pie chart by D3") [Donut chart](https://observablehq.com/@d3/donut-chart/2 "Donut chart by D3") [Radial area chart](https://observablehq.com/@d3/radial-area-chart/2 "Radial area chart by D3") [Radial stacked bar chart](https://observablehq.com/@d3/radial-stacked-bar-chart/2 "Radial stacked bar chart by D3") [Radial stacked bar chart (sorted)](https://observablehq.com/@d3/radial-stacked-bar-chart/3 "Radial stacked bar chart (sorted) by D3")

### Annotation

Labels, legends, axes, titles, guides, and keys help a visualization communicate effectively. Here are a few strategies.

[Inline labels](https://observablehq.com/@d3/inline-labels/2 "Inline labels by D3") [Directly labelling lines](https://observablehq.com/@harrystevens/directly-labelling-lines "Directly labelling lines by Harry Stevens") [Line chart with tooltip](https://observablehq.com/@d3/line-with-tooltip/2 "Line chart with tooltip by D3") [Voronoi labels](https://observablehq.com/@d3/voronoi-labels "Voronoi labels by D3") [Occlusion](https://observablehq.com/@fil/occlusion "Occlusion by Fil") [Graticule labels](https://observablehq.com/@d3/graticule-labels-stereographic "Graticule labels by D3") [Styled axes](https://observablehq.com/@d3/styled-axes "Styled axes by D3") [Color legend](https://observablehq.com/@d3/color-legend "Color legend by D3")

### Maps

D3 implements a dizzying array of [geographic projections](https://observablehq.com/collection/@d3/d3-geo-projection). It works great with [GeoJSON](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GeoJSON), [TopoJSON](https://github.com/topojson), and even [shapefiles](https://observablehq.com/@d3/streaming-shapefiles).

[Choropleth](https://observablehq.com/@d3/choropleth/2 "Choropleth by D3") [Bivariate choropleth](https://observablehq.com/@d3/bivariate-choropleth "Bivariate choropleth by D3") [State choropleth](https://observablehq.com/@d3/us-state-choropleth/2 "State choropleth by D3") [World choropleth](https://observablehq.com/@d3/world-choropleth/2 "World choropleth by D3") [World map](https://observablehq.com/@d3/world-map "World map by D3") [Projection transitions](https://observablehq.com/@d3/projection-transitions "Projection transitions by D3") [Projection comparison](https://observablehq.com/@d3/projection-comparison "Projection comparison by D3") [Antimeridian cutting](https://observablehq.com/@d3/antimeridian-cutting "Antimeridian cutting by D3") [Tissot’s indicatrix](https://observablehq.com/@d3/tissots-indicatrix "Tissot’s indicatrix by D3") [Web Mercator tiles](https://observablehq.com/@d3/web-mercator-tiles "Web Mercator tiles by D3") [Raster tiles](https://observablehq.com/@d3/raster-tiles "Raster tiles by D3") [Vector tiles](https://observablehq.com/@d3/vector-tiles "Vector tiles by D3") [Clipped map tiles](https://observablehq.com/@d3/clipped-map-tiles "Clipped map tiles by D3") [Raster & vector](https://observablehq.com/@d3/raster-vector "Raster & vector by D3") [Vector field](https://observablehq.com/@d3/vector-field "Vector field by D3") [GeoTIFF contours](https://observablehq.com/@d3/geotiff-contours-ii "GeoTIFF contours by D3") [U.S. airports voronoi](https://observablehq.com/@d3/us-airports-voronoi "U.S. airports voronoi by D3") [World airports voronoi](https://observablehq.com/@d3/world-airports-voronoi "World airports voronoi by D3") [Solar terminator](https://observablehq.com/@d3/solar-terminator "Solar terminator by D3") [Solar path](https://observablehq.com/@d3/solar-path "Solar path by D3") [Star map](https://observablehq.com/@d3/star-map "Star map by D3") [Non-contiguous cartogram](https://observablehq.com/@d3/non-contiguous-cartogram "Non-contiguous cartogram by D3")

### Essays

Weave interactive visualizations seamlessly into prose for explorable explanations. Don’t just _tell_ the reader something; let the reader see, engage, and ask questions.
